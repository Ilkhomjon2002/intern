My Intern Project, after finishing react bootcamp We (students) have been given  to develop a website for renting , selling, buying a house  individually. And We have been given ready-made backend to use or to integrate our project. And Website is not fully developed yet I am still continuing to write some parts. About website, The main focus of website is to teach us how to integrate with backend. Fetch, UseQuery, UseMutation and other react features were used in this website.
